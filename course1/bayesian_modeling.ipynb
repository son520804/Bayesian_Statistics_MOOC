Models are simplified descriptions of a given\nsystem or process that, for some reason, we are interested in. Those descriptions are deliberately created\nin order to capture the most relevant aspects of the system. \n\nThere are various kinds of models; we focus our scope on Bayesian models. Particularly, we can summarize the\nBayesian modeling process using three steps:\n\n* Given some data and some assumptions on how this data could have been generated, we can design a model by\ncombining building blocks known as **probability distributions**. Most of the time these models can provide\na crude approximation of the data, and that's all we need.\n\n* We also use Bayes' theorem, a probabilistic update rule, to add data to our models and logically derive\nthe update of assumptions.\n\n* We measure the goodness of models by checking whether the models make sense according to criteria like\ndata, our subject knowledge and sometimes by comparing several models.\n\n\nBayesian models are also known as **probabilistic models** because the building block of which are\nprobability distributions. But why do we use probabilities? It is because probabilities are the correct tool\nto not only model the variables, but also quantify the uncertainty. While statistical world has more than\none definition of probability, from a Bayesian perspective, we define probability is **a measure that\nquantifies the uncertainty level** of a statement. We use the modeling approach that explicitly takes\nuncertainty into account.","metadata":{"cell_id":"00000-64ab4037-d972-45be-b919-56bc9a1db968","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"cell_id":"00001-fd780919-3472-4b3e-ae91-76c24d5e27c5","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"},"deepnote_notebook_id":"070dc3bf-232c-4d59-b94e-a6e45d66ceb8","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
