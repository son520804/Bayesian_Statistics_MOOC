    "Once you have computed a posterior distribution, it's often useful to summarize the results with a single point estimate or an interval. We are particularly looking at interval estimates to capture also the uncertainty of the estimates. We usually report two values together so that a high percentage (e.g. 95%) of unknown value falls between such lower and upper bounds. These values define a **credible interval**.\n",
